## Optimization
The site is optimized according to PageSpeed Insights guidelines and is fully functional even when the user blocks javascript
I Use Lazy load script with SQIP technique.
## Confused
In BEM methodology, I should avoid identifier selectors, but in my case I have to use it because my menu will not work properly when someone blocks js, so now I'm not sure if I should stylize the id element and remove the class, or just leave the id without styling with class.
